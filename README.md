# QR-Code component

Hi everyone üñê !

This is my first project from Frontend Mentor. You can find the challenge [here](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H).

## What did I make this project ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ?

After having followed the amazing [Advanced CSS & Sass course](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/) by Jonas Schmedtmann, I want to evolve and improve my front-end developer skills. I hope this is the beginning of a marathon ü§û !
